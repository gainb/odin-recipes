        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>half cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>half cup medium orange, juiced</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons stevia powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, orange juice, sesame oil, stevia powder, garlic powder, and ginger for teriyaki dressing in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly; continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add vegetable oil and heat until shimmering, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chicken and garlic; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Add broccoli and continue to stir-fry, 4 to 6 minutes. Add bamboo shoots and bell peppers; cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour the teriyaki dressing into the skillet (watch for splattering); cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, and the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in green onion and sesame seeds, reserving some of each for garnish. Serve immediately over cooked white and wild rice with the reserved green onions and sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
